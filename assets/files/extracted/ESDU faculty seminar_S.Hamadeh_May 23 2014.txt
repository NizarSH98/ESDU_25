THE HEALTHY BASKET
Healthy Basket started in 2001 as a project 
by the American University of  Beirut to 
improve Lebanese farmers’ livelihood in 
rural areas, preserving the environment and 
protecting human health by adopting 
organic agriculture as a key strategy.
Fresh, 
certified 
organic 
fruits 
and 
vegetables sold by HB are produced by 
small farmers throughout Lebanon, closely 
supervised by two certification bodies: the 
Lebanese “LibanCert” and the Swiss “Bio 
inspecta”.
